                    You have the possibility to sign up for our newsletter, in which we regularly inform you about news regarding our offers and promotions. For signing up to our newsletter, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure, which means that we will only send you newsletters by e-mail after you, by clicking a link in our notification e-mail, have confirmed that you are the owner of the given e-mail address. If you confirm your e-mail address, we will save your e-mail address, the time of registration and the IP address used for registration until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. The sole purpose of storing this information is to provide you with the newsletter and to prove your registration. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. A corresponding unsubscribe link can be found in every newsletter. A notification sent to the contact details mentioned above or in the newsletter (for example, via e-mail or by mail) is of course also sufficient. The legal basis for the processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR. In addition, we also send out advertising mailings in connection with our services to you. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR, based on our interest in existing customer advertising. For the dispatch of our newsletter and our advertising mailings, we work together with service providers to whom we, among other things, send your e-mail address and the circumstances of your newsletter registration in order to be able to send you the newsletter and advertising mailings (for example, MailChimp of The Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA). Additionally, our newsletter and advertising mailings will to a small extent adapt to the individual needs of our customers. For this, we use the services of Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG, M&auml;rzstra&szlig;e 1, 1150 Vienna, Austria. On the basis of the booking data collected from you, we adapt, for example, the language settings in our mailings or indicate bookable additional services. The disclosure of data to our service providers in connection with newsletter distribution and advertising mailings is based on our legitimate interest in advertising our services to our customers in an interest-based manner. In our newsletters, we use commercially common technologies that measure the interaction with the newsletters (for example, the opening of e-mails, clicked links). We use this data in pseudonymous form for the purpose of general statistical evaluations as well as for the optimization and further development of our content and customer communication. This is done with the help of small graphics that are embedded in the newsletter (so-called pixels). These data are collected exclusively in pseudonymous form and are also not linked with your other personal information. Legal basis for this is our aforementioned legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR. Through our newsletter, we aim to share content relevant to our customers and to better understand what readers are actually interested in. If you do not want to have your usage behavior analyzed, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter or deactivate graphics in your e-mail program. The data for the interaction with our newsletters are stored in pseudonymous form for 30 days and subsequently completely anonymized.
