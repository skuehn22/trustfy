                       <h2>What is Escrow?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Escrow is a legal concept whereby assets are held by a trusted third party while the other two parties complete a transaction. It’s commonly used in property sales: While Seller Sandy and Buyer Bob are finalizing the sale, Trusty Tim holds on to the money and keeps everyone honest. When the sale is complete, Trusty Tim releases the money to Seller Sandy.

                        <p>
                            You might have heard that Apple paid €14 billion in back taxes into an escrow account. In 2016 the European Commission ruled that Apple received unfair tax incentives from Ireland. Apple disagrees. While the two are busy arguing about it in the courts, the money in question is being managed by Goldman Sachs.

                        <h3>Where does Escrow make sense?</h3>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Example 1:Renting out your spare room on Airbnb?</strong><br>
                            Great! Now imagine you have to send an invoice to every guest after they stay.<br>
                            To Mexico, Finland and Texas, hoping they’ll remember to pay you.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Example 2:Selling things online</strong><br>
                            How about selling your super-exclusive-collectable-edition of Sting CDs online?<br>
                            Just wrap that baby up and drop it off to your post office with an invoice attached!<br>
                            You might want to have some friendly reminder messages ready to go in case the lucky buyer isn’t prompt on paying.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Here’s where escrow comes in:</h3>
                        <p>
                            A trusted third party hold a buyer’s money until the seller has delivered a good or service. <br>Then they release that money.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Airbnb holds a guest’s money until they’ve checked in; <br>eBay holds that Sting enthusiast’s money until the CDs arrive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That means buyers don’t have to pay up front without seeing what they’re getting. And sellers don’t have to cross their fingers hoping to get paid at the end of the day.
                        </p>

                        <h3>I know I’ve heard that term before…</h3>

                        <p>
                            Yep. You’ve probably seen the note plastered on “House For Sale” signs. In Escrow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That means the buyer is ready to buy the house and has given the money to a third party during final negotiations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If John is selling his house to Sally, he wants to know the money is there before he signs away his rights. Sally, on the other hand, isn’t going to hand over the money until all is said, done and signed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That’s why the Escrow Agent or Broker holds on to Sally’s money until John hands over the deed to the house, then he releases it to John.

                        </p>

                        <h3>What else is escrow used for?</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you can sell it, I’ll bet my bottom dollar someone has used escrow to pay for it. Art, tickets, property, toast that looks like Oprah… let’s stop there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maybe it was called something else. Escrow sounds intimidating and a lot of business talk around the term and call it “buyer and seller protection” or some variation on “secure payment system.” At the end of the day, it’s all about getting buyer and seller a fair deal.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you’re buying or selling work, you should have the same right to payment protection than if you’re buying or selling CDs. Or renting out your spare room.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That’s where Trustfy comes in.

                            Say this time, Sally is creating a promotional video for John’s bakery. John doesn’t want to pay Sally until he’s seen the video. But Sally doesn‘t want to create a gorgeous video for John and then hope he’ll pay her once he has it.
                        </p>

                            With Trustfy, John pays in to a secure account and the money is held while Sally works. Once the video is complete, John authorizes the release to Sally.

                        <p>
                            John doesn’t have to blindly trust Sally, and Sally can work with confidence knowing she’ll be paid!
