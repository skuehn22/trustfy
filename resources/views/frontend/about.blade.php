                <p><i><strong>"My dad was a contractor, so I grew up watching him struggle to get paid.
                    Chasing a payment after he'd done good work really chipped away at his
                    pride.</strong></i></p>

                <p><i><strong>When I started freelancing myself, I got to feel that first hand.</strong></i></p>
                <p><i><strong>I want to change the way things are done because no one should have to
                    worry if their money is safe. Not freelancers. Not clients."</strong></i></p>
                <p><strong>Sebastian<br>Co-founder and CTO</strong></p>

                <br><br>

                <p style="text-align: center">We founded Trustfy because we want to make the future of work fairer, more
                    transparent and more sustainable for everyone involved.
                    It’s why we get up in the morning.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">
                    More and more people are working for themselves and that has the potential to
                    be a great thing.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">But it also means clients don’t have the security of working with a larger firm
                    and freelancers don’t have the security of a full-time employer.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">When it comes to paying and getting paid, that can cause issues for everyone
                    involved. We, and a lot of people we care dearly about, have lost the better part
                    of our sanity in this process.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center">As a client, you’re asked to pay a good chunk of the bill up front- then you cross
                    your fingers that everything works out.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center">As a freelancer, you do the work and cross your fingers that you won’t be
                    chasing payments later.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">It’s stressful for everyone involved. And it’s unnecessary.
    That's why we're making the system fairer, so that everyone involved can have
    the peace of mind they deserve.</p>
