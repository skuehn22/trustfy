                <p>It is the sole responsibility of Buyers and Sellers to create and sign a contract prior to making a payment via Trustfy. If a Seller uploads terms of service, a detailed project plan or a contract alongside the payment plan and a Buyer makes a payment, Trustfy will consider such an action a de facto agreement to said terms, plan or contract.</p>
                <p>Payments made without uploading terms, project plans or contracts are at the Seller&rsquo;s risk. Any mediation performed by Trustfy bases on such terms, project plans or contracts. If no such context exists, mediation is not possible.

                <p>By clicking to fund an Escrow milestone or project, Buyer and Seller are deemed to have executed these Escrow Instructions electronically, effective immediately.

By accepting these terms, users are agreeing to comply with all such requests. These can include, but are not limited to, proof of identity, proof of address or company registration.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc535245057"></a>Release and Delivery of Amounts in Escrow</h2>
                <p>Buyer and Seller irrevocably authorize and instruct Trustfy to release applicable portions of the escrowed funds upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the Terms of Service. The amount of the Release will be delivered to the applicable Escrow Account in accordance with Seller&rsquo;s or Buyer&rsquo;s instructions, as applicable, these Escrow Instructions, and the other Terms of Service.</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc535245058"></a>Dispute Assistance Program</h2>
                <p>Dispute Assistance is only available if (i) one or more Escrow Milestones have been funded, and (ii) prior to the Dispute Assistance Deadline (30 days after Buyer was billed for the last milestone). Dispute Assistance is not available to either the Seller or the Buyer via the Platform after the Dispute Assistance Deadline.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trustfy will first attempt to assist Buyer and Seller by reviewing the dispute and proposing a mutual, non-binding resolution.</li>
                    <li>The Trustfy team will notify Buyer and Seller via ticket by providing a notice of dispute along with a request for information and supporting documentation (if any).</li>
                    <li>If both Buyer and Seller respond to the notice and request for information, then the Trustfy team will review the documentation submitted and any information available on the Site that pertains to the Dispute. After review, the Trustfy team will propose a mutual, non-binding resolution based on the results of the review.</li>
                    <li>The proposed resolution is non-binding; Buyer and Seller can choose whether or not to agree to it. If Buyer and Seller agree in writing to the proposed resolution, Buyer and Seller agree that Trustfy is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release Escrow funds in accordance with the proposed resolution.</li>
                    <li>If Buyer or Seller rejects Trustfy&rsquo;s proposed, non-binding resolution, they may proceed to Arbitration. If Buyer and Seller do not choose to arbitrate, Seller and Buyer agree that Trustfy Escrow is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release to Buyer all funds held in Escrow.</li>
                    <li>If Buyer or Seller chooses to arbitrate they must notify Trustfy in writing of their intent to arbitrate. During arbitration, Trustfy will continue to hold the escrowed funds and will release escrowed funds in accordance with the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision.</li>
                    <li>If Buyer and Seller do not initiate arbitration within 14 days of rejecting Trustfy&rsquo;s non-binding resolution, then Buyer and Seller will be deemed to have authorized and instructed Trustfy Escrow to, and Trustfy Escrow will, release the disputed funds to Buyer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If either Buyer or Seller demands Arbitration in accordance with these Escrow Instructions and you are not the party that requested Arbitration, you agree to submit to the Arbitration and pay your share of any Arbitration fees that may arise as a result.</p>
                <p>By default, such Arbitration will be conducted by the neutral third-party dispute resolution service, ADR Group. Trustfy retains the right to choose a different dispute resolution body if circumstances necessitate.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc535245059"></a>Escrowed Funds Release Conditions</h2>
                <p>As used in these Escrow Instructions, &ldquo;Release Condition&rdquo; means any of the following:</p>

                    <li>Buyer does not take any action for 14 days from the date of a Seller&rsquo;s release request, in which case Buyer and Seller agree that Trustfy is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release to the Seller the amount associated with to the applicable milestone in connection with such release request.</li>
                    <li>Seller cancels the contract before a milestone payment has been released to Seller, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.</li>
                    <li>Buyer and Seller have submitted joint written instructions for a release to either the Seller&rsquo;s escrow account or the Buyer&rsquo;s escrow account, as applicable.</li>
                    <li>Buyer and Seller agree to close the contract without release of funds, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.</li>
                    <li>Buyer or Seller have failed to make their arbitration payment or paid its fair share of the arbitration costs that arise during third party arbitration, in which case the funds are released to the Party that has made its Arbitration Payment.</li>
                    <li>Both Buyer and Seller have failed to timely submit to Arbitration for an unresolved Dispute, in which case the funds are released to the Buyer.</li>
                    <li>Buyer or Seller has failed timely to respond to a Trustfy Dispute Assistance notification as required by the Dispute Assistance Program, in which case the funds are released to the User that has participated.</li>

                    <li>We believe, in our sole discretion, that fraud, an illegal act, or a violation of Trustfy&rsquo;s Terms of Service has been committed or is being committed or attempted, in which case Buyer and Seller irrevocably authorize and instruct Trustfy to take such actions as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion and in accordance with applicable law, in order to prevent or remedy such acts, including without limitation to return the funds associated with such acts to their source of payment.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc535245060"></a>Instructions Irrevocable</h2>
                <p>On the occurrence of a Release Condition, Buyer and Seller agree that the instruction to Trustfy to release funds is irrevocable. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer&rsquo;s instruction to Trustfy to pay a Seller is irrevocable. Such instruction is Buyer&rsquo;s authorization to transfer funds to Seller from the Buyer Escrow Account or authorization to charge Buyer&rsquo;s Payment Method.</p>
                <p>Such instruction is also Buyer&rsquo;s representation that Buyer has received, inspected and accepted the subject work or expense. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that upon receipt of Buyer&rsquo;s instruction to pay Seller, Trustfy will transfer funds to the Seller and that Trustfy and other Affiliates have no responsibility to and may not be able to recover such funds. Therefore, and in consideration of services described in this Agreement, Buyer agrees that once Trustfy has charged Buyer&rsquo;s Payment Method, the charge is non-refundable.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc535245061"></a><strong>User Responsibility</strong></h2>
                <p>Trustfy shall not be liable for any loss or damages arising because of any payments processed, or attempted to be processed, through the Platform. This includes transactions that were not processed due to a network communication error, or any other reason.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If you initiate a transaction, it is your responsibility to verify that the transaction was successfully processed by the designated payment processor.</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc535245062"></a><strong>Collection of Payment Information</strong></h2>
                <p>By using Trustfy&rsquo;s invoicing tool, you authorize Trustfy to collect your name, address, telephone number, email address, and payment method. In addition, Trustfy or the designated payment processor may collect additional payment, billing, and bank information necessary to process the transaction. As part of the payment process, you agree to provide current, complete, and accurate information related to this process.</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc535245063"></a><strong>Payment Destination Prohibitions</strong></h2>
                <p>You may not, for any reason, pay yourself or your organization through the Platform. Sellers also may not make a payment on behalf of a Buyer using their payment information.&nbsp;Doing either is considered a violation of this Terms of Service and will result in your account being terminated.</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc535245064"></a><strong>Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure</strong></h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h2><a name="_Toc535245066"></a><strong>Required Disclosure</strong></h2>
                <p>In the event Trustfy is requested or required by legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, we shall give you prompt notice so that you may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief prior to any such disclosure.&nbsp; In the event that such protective order is not obtained, Trustfy shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that its legal counsel advises that it is legally required to disclose, and shall work with the owner of such Confidential Information to minimize the extent and effect.</p>
